# Co-Home Premium

## Assumptions:
1. Existing pricing is market rate
2. People in community have common values
3. Nomadic & Entrepeneurial people want to hang out with relatable people
4. These people want to integrate into the tech scene 100x faster

## Question:
1. Will people pay > (1) given (2) and (3).

## Method:
1. Collect everyone you know together in a group + page
2. Start posting content / events etc from the page and into the group
3. Launch landing page with fb pixel on and get everyone to share
    * Needs clear CTA -> Airbnb
    * Needs clear value prop
    * Needs a FOMO wall?
    * Needs Social proof
    * have a mailinglist / telegram chat / fb group
4. 10 ads per week (each a variation of 3 images, 3 headlines, 3 descriptions) and measure success by visits + offline conversions (since volume will be low). Each week, cull the 8/9 worst performing, iterate on the 1/2 best performing. Repeat.

## Notes:

* Do you want anyone who will pay or do you want to vet people? (do you already vet people? Make that a wall infront of the offer to introduce FOMO).
* Need social proof e.g. People who have lived in the home on the site, linked in profiles?
* Have a mailing list where projects for people who have stayed are posted / interesting eutrepeneurial stuff is shared.
* Guest blog posts from people who have stayed / retrospectives of things you've changed and improves due to changes.
* Our parteners (events you go to, people you know etc).
